Fork of BrowserMob's python command-line client for use as a library.

Wrapped existing methods with classes and added a 24-hour default start and end time for queries. Mainly because I'll be damned if I have to query for a seconds since epoch every time I want to get some JSON.

API documentation:
	http://cdn.browsermob.com/api.html

API example:
	import the BMOB api into your python class. Then look at lines 141-142 of api.py for how a calling example.
	
Minimal requirements:
	python2.5 or later
	simplejson or json module

TODO: Add some unit testing.
